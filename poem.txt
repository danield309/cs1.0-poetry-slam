He woke up, he's Kanye West.
This day he hoped he would be his Kanye best.
He first unlocked a Kanye chest.
He got dressed and went to a Kanye fest.
He cleaned up his house because he was welcoming a Kanye guest.
He threw a rock at a tree because he was trying to get down a Kanye nest.
He put a few traps around his house because he was trying to get rid of Kanye pest.
A spirit came out of his Kanye chest,
And told him to go on a Kanye Quest.
After that he went to sleep to get some Kanye rest.
He woke up and went straight to studying for his Kanye test.
He heard it's dangerous around so he put on a Kanye vest.
After all his trouble, Kanye West will always try to be his Kanye best.
